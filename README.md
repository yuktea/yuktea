### My Experiences
- <p> I've worked with quite a bit of Java and Spring Boot, which has been central during my experiences in Fintech and some university courses. I've also worked with React/JS along with UI/UX design (I'd like to think I have a keen eye for it üòâ) </p> Most my work has been full stack; Basically going through the entire user journey from UI/UX design through to testing. 

### What I'm learning right now
- I'm currently focusing on learning about scalable systems and their design to get better as an engineer.

### What I do when I'm not programming
- Likely watching Anime üèØ
